## Quick Links
- [Manifold documentation](https://manifoldscholar.github.io/manifold-docusaurus/docs) is the best place to find the nuts-and-bolts about every inch of the platform.
- [Manifold walkthroughs](https://manifoldscholar.github.io/manifold-docusaurus/docs/walkthroughs/landing) provide step-by-step guides for key project tasks.
    - [Make a Project](https://manifoldscholar.github.io/manifold-docusaurus/docs/walkthroughs/making_project) takes a Project Creator through the basic steps for starting a project from scratch
    - [Ingesting Word Docs](https://manifoldscholar.github.io/manifold-docusaurus/docs/walkthroughs/word_mammoth) is especially helpful if you're working with more advanced styles and want more control mapping those styles in Manifold
- [Manifold Key Concepts for Accessibility](https://uw.manifoldapp.org/projects/manifoldaccess) by Elliott Stevens at the University of Washington has great information about things you want to check as you work on your Manifold project.

## Getting Started

Feel free to use this project during your project creation. Projects come to Manifold in a number of different ways, whether teaching coursebooks, faculty research projects, student editions, or course collaborations, they all share basic components.

This handbook or "User-Docs" isn't comprehensive. It's meant to help when you want some basic guidelines for a project. Manifold isn't a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) word processor like Microsoft Word, so you have to be more precise in how you set up your files so that things look the way you want them to. For first time publishers, this can seem obscure and difficult, but it does become easier as you work on your project.

## Tips
1. draft outside of Manifold
The best starting advice is to draft your project contents outside of Manifold. If you're comfortable in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, those are great places to start. 
2. organize your materials
Having your different files organized and well labelled will help as you build your project. We recommend using descriptive filenames with no spaces or special characters.
3. keep trying
Manifold is relatively intuitive, but any new platform will take time to learn.This guide will discuss some suggestions for putting your project together (have a cover! have a brief description!), but the main decisions will be yours to make (am I constructing a single text of many sections? Or a project comprised of many texts? Do I want to publish a journal?) If you encounter issues, don't assume it's you. As with any open source project, you may encounter bugs and you may need to troubleshoot. [Manifold Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/manifold-community/shared_invite/zt-1z2hipgyr-aC7S0p5zCVJclJiKx9oakQ) is a great place to bring questions of any kind.
